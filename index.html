                <p>Dear Selina,</p>
                <p>Happy belated seven-month anniversary, my love! I can’t believe it’s already been seven months since we started this amazing journey together. I’m really sorry for being late with your gift. You know how life gets sometimes! I hope you can forgive me. Honestly, I just want to take a moment to say thank you for being the best girlfriend anyone could ever ask for. You really are incredible, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.</p>
                <p>Thinking back to when we first started dating, it’s wild to see how far we’ve come. Neither of us had a clue what we were doing, did we? It felt a bit like we were just diving into the deep end without floaties! But somehow, we’ve managed to keep our heads above water, and I’m so grateful for that. You’ve been by my side through all the awkward moments, the excitement, and even the times when we didn’t quite know how to navigate this thing called love. And honestly, I can’t imagine my life without you now.</p>
                <p>There were definitely times when I worried if this was all too good to be true. I kept thinking, “Is this really happening?” There were moments I questioned if this was serious, or if you were just messing with my head. But as the days turned into weeks and then into months, it became clear that this was something special. You’re here for me—understanding, loving, and supporting me in ways I didn’t even know I needed. Even on those days when I’m super busy or when my mind is all over the place, you still manage to be there for me. Your patience blows me away, and it makes me appreciate you even more.</p>
                <p>What really gets me is how well you know me. If you asked my family or friends what I love the most, they probably wouldn’t have a clue. But you? You’ve taken the time to learn about me—my quirks, my dreams, even my weirdest interests. You see me for who I really am, and that’s something I’ve never had with anyone else. It’s like you’ve unlocked a part of me that I didn’t even know existed. That’s when I really understood how deep your love is for me, and I want you to know that I feel the same way about you.</p>
                <p>I know my family can be a bit tough about relationships like ours. They just don’t really get it, and honestly, that’s okay. I decided to be open about you with them because I want you to feel important in my life. You mean the world to me, and I’m willing to stand up for us, no matter what. No matter what challenges we face, I promise I’ll never let you go. You have my heart, Selina, and I love you more than words can say.</p>
                <p>You know, I also used to think that love was just a fairytale thing, something that only happened in movies. Sure, I’ve had crushes and flings, but nothing ever felt real until you came along. With those other people, it was like I was just going through the motions. But with you, everything is different. You’re special, and you’ve changed my perspective on love. You’ve made me want to be a better person, and I can’t thank you enough for that.</p>
                <p>I can’t help but think about all the amazing moments we’ve had together. Remember that day we just hung out and talked for hours? We laughed so much, and I felt like I could tell you anything. Those late-night talks are some of my favorite memories. We can talk about everything and anything, from silly topics to our biggest dreams. Those moments have helped us grow closer, and I cherish each and every one of them.</p>
                <p>And let’s not forget the adventures we’ve had! Whether it was grabbing ice cream on a whim or just exploring BGC late at night (where I would escape on the house without notice), every outing with you feels like an adventure. I’ll never forget our day at Tagaytay with my mother’s side of the family—just soaking up the sun and enjoying each other’s company. Your laugh is infectious, and every time I hear it, I can’t help but smile. It’s those little things that make me realize how much I’ve fallen for you.</p>
                <p>As we look ahead to our future, I want our relationship to keep growing stronger. Even when life gets busy and we don’t talk as much, I want you to know that I understand. We both have our own lives and responsibilities, and that’s totally okay. As long as we stay committed to each other, I believe we can handle anything that comes our way. Let’s keep supporting each other and having fun while we figure this all out together.</p>
                <p>I dream about all the things we’ll do in the future. I want to travel with you, experience new places, and create memories that will last a lifetime. Let’s keep finding joy in the little things, like binge-watching our favorite shows or just hanging out at home. I want to make the most of every moment we have together, no matter how big or small.</p>
                <p>Selina, you mean the world to me. You’re my partner in crime, my confidante, and my best friend. I feel so lucky to have you in my life. You’ve brought so much happiness into my days, and I want you to know how much I appreciate everything you do. You deserve to feel cherished, and I promise to show you how much you mean to me every day.</p>
                <p>As we celebrate our seven-month anniversary, I want to reflect on all the little things that make our relationship special. From our inside jokes to the quiet moments we share, each memory is a thread in the fabric of our love. They fill me with hope for the future, and I’m excited to create even more beautiful moments with you.</p>
                <p>I also want to emphasize how important communication is for us. Being able to talk openly has helped us navigate any bumps in the road. I appreciate that we can discuss things honestly and work through any misunderstandings. This ability to talk things out is something I value deeply, and it makes our relationship even stronger.</p>
                <p>You’ve inspired me to pursue my dreams, and I love seeing you chase yours, too. Your ambition and passion are contagious, and I admire everything you do. I want you to know that I’m here cheering you on every step of the way. I believe in you wholeheartedly, and I’m excited to see all the amazing things you’ll accomplish.</p>
                <p>As I look back on these past seven months, I’m filled with gratitude for every moment we’ve shared. Each laugh, each late-night conversation, each adventure—it all adds up to something beautiful. I can’t wait to create even more memories with you, filled with laughter and love.</p>
                <p>In closing, I want to remind you just how much you mean to me. You’re my heart, my happiness, and my greatest adventure. I love you more than I can say, Selina. Here’s to many more months and years together, filled with love, growth, and all the adventures our hearts can hold.</p>
                <p>With love,<br>Hannah</p>
